  <p>Alan Turing (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954) was a pioneering British computer scientist,
    mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential
    in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts
    of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model
    of a general purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of
    theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. </p>
